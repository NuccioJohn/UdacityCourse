Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: So that different peoples commits do not overwrite each others changes. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: Forks are only used on GitHub to copy a Github repository to another Github repository. Clones can copy a
repoistory on your computer or from GitHub. Branches are used to keep two different Version controlled copies
of a project so you can work on both version simultaneously.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work on a plane, I can update 
my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own 
branches yet.  Then if I want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the remote 
version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I tend to work directly in master more often when I'm working on my own orvwith just one or two other people.  When working with a 
large group, though, using branches to keep track of which changes have already been reviewed and approved is extremely helpful.
